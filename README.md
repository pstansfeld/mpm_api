## The MemProtMD API
The MemProtMD API provides programmatic access to the MemProtMD database, enabling integration with external applications, including this platform. The API is freely available for use in any application, provided that all data retrieved through the API is appropriately attributed to MemProtMD.

### General notes
To validate API functionality, we recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for testing the endpoints described in this documentation. Postman also supports automatic generation of code snippets in multiple programming languages for integration into computational workflows.  
All examples provided in this guide utilize Python with the `requests` library.

## User Guide
Reference implementation is currently available as a Jupyter notebook. Users are encouraged to contribute improvements or more user-friendly solutions by submitting a pull request to the repository.
